General premises and intentions for why we exist.

Recycle Ithaca's Bicycles is an environment and an entity with activism and
cross-struggle solidarity in it's DNA. While the environment focuses
primarily on bicycles and sharing of knowledge (and therefore power), the
overall entity considers agendas of movements concerned with building
sustainable, fair, ecologically balanced systems and ending abuse and
unjust oppression fundamental to formatting its ethics and policy. Some
might, at a glance, wonder if these observances are out of scope,
considering the bicycle is a machine. What do social movements have to do
with a machine?

That answer can be found in exactly what kind of machine a bicycle is.
A bicycle holds a rare place among humanity's inventions; once made,
it requires little in the way of further natural resources to fulfill
its function. It is not disposable - the primary components of bicycles
can, if properly tended, perform their functions for multiple human
lifetimes. Relatively little money is required to maintain a bicycle, and
relatively little space. Even to the present day, it has been calculated
to be the most efficient land vehicle ever invented. Bicycles, in most
places, do not require a license or insurance to operate, and yet are
fully privileged vehicles on the street. Bicycles are simple enough for
anyone to understand, and complex enough that the process of understanding
them will educate the observer in enduring principles of design and physics
applicable to devices and machinery at large.

In short, the bicycle is a working, physical schematic for equilibrium, for
ecological responsibility, for egalitarianism, for efficiency, for erosion
of class boundaries, for education, for liberation without undue destruction,
for exponential empowerment, for freedom. It is one of the few devices to
answer so many of humanity's needs and desires at so little cost. And all of
these principles are contained in a form that has not diminished in its pure
exhilarating fun for over a hundred and twenty years and counting.

So, in many ways Recycle Ithaca's Bicycles sees in the bicycle a hint at
answers sought in the machinery of our own society. Struggles ignored by
massive governmental systems and deeply biased social and economic gatekeepers
can and are assisted easily by the bicycle and it's other well-built,
well-designed, human-powered cousins. For Recycle Ithaca's Bicycles, awareness
of abuse and unjust oppression, and the radical, liberating, creative,
beautiful and balanced systems required to offset or end abuse and oppression,
are one and the same as studying and understanding the nature of the bicycle
and supporting and enhancing its use and reproduction.
